# AI Study Assistant 🤖📘

## Project Title
Build an AI Chatbot Using LLMs

## Description
AI Study Assistant is a simple AI-based chatbot application developed using Python.  
The application allows users to ask academic questions and receive answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in different explanation styles.

This project demonstrates the basic working of a full-stack AI application by integrating a frontend, backend, and an AI model API.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a full-stack AI chatbot application using modern AI tools and software engineering practices.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **FastAPI** – Backend framework  
- **Streamlit** – Frontend framework  
- **LLM API (OpenRouter)** – For AI-generated responses  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  

---

## System Architecture
1. The user enters a question in the Streamlit frontend.
2. The frontend sends the request to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend forwards the question to the LLM API.
4. The AI model generates a response.
5. The backend sends the response back to the frontend.
6. The answer is displayed to the user.

This follows a simple request–response client-server architecture.

---

## Features
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- AI-powered question answering
- Multiple answer styles:
  - Simple
  - Detailed
  - Exam-ready
- Real-time response generation using LLM API
